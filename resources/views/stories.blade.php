                <h2>Boost Your Productivity at Work with Your Daily Islamic Prayers</h2>
                <p>
                    The key to success is prayer. This is something engraved in the muslim mind. But as humans we forget,
                    especially when we
                    are working long hours trying to survive the capitalistic lifestyle. From the early morning Fajr
                    prayer to the
                    night-time Isha prayer, each prayer offers its own unique benefits, including seeking guidance, taking
                    a break to
                    recharge, and seeking forgiveness.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So why not start your workday with the right mindset and intention, and tap into the
                    spiritual power of these daily Islamic prayers?
